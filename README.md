Portrait of a Programmer
ConvertPrint is a class that uses Converters and UnnecessaryExtension as tools

I call this package "Conversions" on my desktop.
Its my first real program.
Enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 to solve metric to customary conversion problems.



My friend showed me how to make a method and something clicked.
It is now a profound artistic and intelletual outlet of mine.
GitHub will exhibit my first creations.
